Being one of reviewers of her internship work and collaborating on Clockify project, I had the pleasure of working with her for six months. Thing we have in common is that we both started programming from scratch. Having that in mind, I really admire the way she handled all work-related challenges. As she encountered new technologies such as HTML, CSS, SASS, Compass and AngularJS, she proved to be quick-learner by gaining hands-on experience. The biggest rivalry we had at the table football where she shook my confidence from time to time. On the other hand, her persistency and devotion to the game, she demonstrated in the work too. As highly motivated teammate, Jelena would be an asset to any organization..",
